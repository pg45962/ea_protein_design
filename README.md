## Deep learning generative models for novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody design

The objective of this work was to use a previously established framework and adapt it to enhance its enzyme generation capabilities according to the objective of this work.

Frameworks used throughout this project:

GenProtEA - https://github.com/martinsM17/GenProtEA.git
VAE - deep-protein-generation - https://github.com/alex-hh/deep-protein-generation.git
Protein-proetin binding optimization - GenOpt
